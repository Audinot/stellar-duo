# Well, we had to try it.

It's important to try new things. That's what keeps us going. We wanted to try new things too, and make new music. That's why we started Stellar Waves Duo. At least, I think that's what we're called. It's sort of a work in progress right now.

## We have a lot planned.

Right now, the first step we're taking is our Mix Tape recordings, a set of various violin duets that we really like. You can think of it as a taster - repertoire that interests us, from Telemann to Ysaye.

# Want to hear more?

You got it! Two violinists, coming right up.
